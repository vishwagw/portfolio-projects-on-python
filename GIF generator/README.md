This is a portfolio project created by me using python programmin language and its tools/libraries.

First we are going to learn about the GIF. GIF is short for Graphical Interchange Format. 
Mostly, GIF are beign used as memes in the internet or for communication tool in the internet.

In this project we are going to create a GIF generator that can generate gifs from the images.

Now we have to know about tools and libraries we need for the project.
1.Tkinter - to build a GUI
2.glob - to extract files from the computer
3.imageio - to read and classify images


after importing the libraries and modules, we are going to write the code.

Next step is to create user input.
first we create a design for the interface.
then we create a path for input folder.
