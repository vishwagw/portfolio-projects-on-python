In this project, we are going to create a work hour monitor for make a data history about our productivity.

We need Flask as a toool for the program.
Flask is a micro-framework for the python language.
with Flask, we can have the basic resources for creating a web application.

There are some parts of the program structure.

2. overtime.db
3. README.md
4. req.txt
5. templates 
6. static - style.css
