This is a small and easy python project for detecting plagarism percentage between two  different text files.
plagarism usually means the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own.
this is  illegal and unacceptable work as it is basically stealing someone else's hardwork.

So, we have written a simple python script to identify the plagarism score / percentage between two text files.

First, we need to import an impoetant library called 'difflib'. from difflib we need a tool called 'SequenceMatcher'.

we need to locate two files inside the same folder with the python script. if you need to identify original and the file we need to know the plagarism score:

identify the dem1.txt as - original_file not one_file
identify the dem2.txt as - second_file
