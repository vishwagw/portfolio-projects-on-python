In this project we are going to create a captcha maker.
The CAPTCHA is used in various websites to check whether the user is a human or a robot. 
It is mainly used for security purposes. For using CAPTCHA, except for humans, no one can enter the website. 
Its main goal is to develop practical solutions to experimental problems that are easy for humans but difficult for robots or computers. 
They test the cognitive ability of the users.

The task is to create a unique CAPTCHA for each time and check whether the user is human. 
The user needs to enter the Captcha that was automatically generated and examine the generated Captcha with the user input.

First, we have to think about the Algorithm.

1. Firstly, we have to think about the libraires.
we need random library.

2. creating the captcha function
